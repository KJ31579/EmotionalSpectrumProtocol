Emotional Spectrum Protocol – Theory Overview

1. Emotions as States:
   - Emotions are modeled as discrete system states, not human feelings.
   - Each state acts as a control signal affecting system behavior.

2. Visual Coding:
   - States are represented by colors for fast, intuitive display.
   - Use color to convey system mood or status in interfaces and IoT devices.

3. Basic Palette:
   - Select three anchor colors from the visible spectrum, equally spaced.
   - Anchors map to core states: joy, anger, fear.

4. Spectrum Division:
   - Divide the hue wheel into three equal sectors centered on the anchors.
   - Intermediate states computed by blending nearest anchor colors.

5. Core States and Edges:
   - Joy   (neutral) → middle of spectrum → chartreuse (180,255,90)
   - Anger (+1)     → right-edge of spectrum → red       (255,40,40)
   - Fear  (−1)     → left-edge of spectrum  → deep purple (110,70,175)

6. Border States:

   * Hostility – midpoint between Anger and Joy, shown as amber (RGB 218,148,65)
   * Thrill    – midpoint between Fear and Joy, shown as olive-teal (RGB 145,162,132)

7. Five Fundamental States:

   * Joy       (neutral)             → chartreuse    (180,255, 90)
   * Anger     (extreme positive)    → red           (255, 40, 40)
   * Fear      (extreme negative)    → deep purple   (110, 70,175)
   * Hostility (borderline anger/joy)→ amber         (218,148, 65)
   * Thrill    (borderline joy/fear) → olive-teal     (145,162,132)
