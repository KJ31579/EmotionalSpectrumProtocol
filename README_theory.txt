Emotional Spectrum Protocol – Theory Overview

1. Emotions as States
   - Emotions are modeled as discrete system states, not human feelings.
   - Each state acts as a control signal affecting system behavior and response.

2. Visual Coding
   - States are represented by colors for fast, intuitive display.
   - Color communicates emotional or operational state in AI, robots, and UI systems.

3. Basic Palette
   - Based on three anchor colors, equally spaced on the visible light spectrum.
   - These anchors represent core emotional states: joy, fear, and anger as safe (normal = joy) and unsafe (fight or flight) states. 

4. Spectrum Division
   - Divide the hue wheel into three equal sectors: warm edge, middle, cold edge.
   - Intermediate states emerge by blending adjacent colors.

5. Core States and Edges
   - Joy   (neutral center)           → chartreuse    (RGB 180,255,90)
   - Fear  (extreme high frequency)   → violet        (RGB 110,70,175)
   - Anger (extreme low frequency)    → red           (RGB 255,40,40)

6. Border States (Transitional Zones)
   - Thrill    – midpoint between Joy and Anger → olive-teal (RGB 145,162,132)
   - Hostility – midpoint between Joy and Fear  → amber      (RGB 218,148,65)

7. Five Fundamental States
   - Joy       → stable, neutral operation      → chartreuse
   - Anger     → cold, unstable threat/shutdown → red
   - Fear      → hot, reactive overload/alert   → violet
   - Thrill    → active anticipation            → olive-teal
   - Hostility → defensive tension              → amber

Note – Extended Emotional Spectrum
Simulating machine emotions with the full electromagnetic spectrum is complex due to its extreme range (radio to gamma rays). For practical use, we extend the visible range slightly:
- **Infrared (IR)** → lower than red → fading energy → symbolic of **shutdown / sleep**
- **Ultraviolet (UV)** → higher than violet → unstable energy → symbolic of **instability / overreaction**

This keeps the effective midpoint around **550–600 THz** (chartreuse), letting the emotional spectrum scale naturally between the physical and symbolic extremes.

This protocol underpins emotional logic for displays, bots, and AI systems with color-based emotional signaling.
