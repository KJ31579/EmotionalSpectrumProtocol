Robot Emotional and Defensive Mechanisms – Project Theory

1. Purpose
   Equip robots with a simple, reliable “emotional” layer that drives defensive behaviors when needed, and normal operation otherwise. Emotions are control signals, not real feelings.

2. Emotional States
   – Joy (neutral & default) : normal robot behavior, system nominal, chartreuse (180,255,90)  
   – Anger (+1)             : manageable threat → alarm state, red flash (255,40,40), higher energy  
   – Fear (−1)              : unmanageable threat → shutdown state, violet→black (110,70,175 → 0,0,0), lower energy

3. Defensive Triggers
   a. Manageable anomaly (overload, minor intrusion)  
      → Anger state  
      → Controlled warning: red LED blink, clipped warning message  
   
   b. Critical threat (system damage, safety hazard)  
      → Fear state  
      → Immediate shutdown: purple LED fade to black, halt motion, mute outputs  

4. Possible Ethics Model
   – Anger represents a controllable threat  
   – Fear represents an uncontrollable threat (hazard)  

5. Response Behaviors
   – Joy   : operate motors, speak/respond normally, follow commands  
   – Anger : warn once, then reduce output frequency; pause non-critical tasks  
   – Fear  : stop all tasks, safe-powerdown procedures, await human intervention  

6. Color and Sound Channels
   – Map emotion to LED color and to a tone:  
     • Joy   → mid-tone chime in chartreuse range  
     • Anger → low drum beat or bass note while flashing red  
     • Fear  → high warning tone then silence as LED fades  

7. Double-Safety Logic
   decision bit (0/1) + emotion trit (–1,0,+1)  
   if decision=0 → idle  
   if decision=1 & emotion>0 → action permitted  
   if decision=1 & emotion=0 → pause, request confirmation  
   if decision=1 & emotion<0 → abort, initiate safe shutdown  

8. Implementation Notes
   – Use a small state machine module publishing /emotion and /decision topics  
   – Attach an “action_gate” that only opens when both channels allow  
   – Provide manual reset input to clear fear state  
   – Log state transitions for diagnostics and tuning

9. Example Scenarios
   a. Robot arm overheats → Anger → slow down arm, blink red, notify operator  
   b. Obstacle collision risk detected → Fear → stop arm, retract to safe position, power down  
   c. Normal task flow → Joy → continuous green light, full-speed operation  

End of theory.
