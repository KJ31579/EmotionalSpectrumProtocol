# Emotional Spectrum Protocol

**Implementing emotions as code** — using mathematical models, color palettes, and binary/ternary logic to simulate emotional states in AI, UI systems, robotics, and embedded logic.

This project explores how emotions can be represented as control signals, mapped to visible spectrum colors, and used to drive reactive or expressive behaviors in machines. The system uses a defined color-emotion logic, ternary emotional states, and visual/audio feedback to represent machine mood or decision reliability.

## Applications
- Emotional UI feedback (color-coded messages)
- Emotionally responsive robots and agents
- Safety logic for AI actions based on emotional “confidence”
- Visual-audio interfaces using emotional spectrum mapping
- Emotion-to-color or music visualization
- Educational tools for explaining emotion-state logic

## Technical Concepts
- Emotions = system states (not feelings)
- Joy = neutral/default (chartreuse)
- Fear = high-frequency alarm state (violet → UV)
- Anger = low-frequency shutdown state (red → IR)
- Mixed states (e.g. thrill, hostility) are blends between core colors
- Emotional logic uses ternary encoding: −1 (anger), 0 (joy), +1 (fear)

## Known Notes
> ⚠️ *At first (since I’m no physicist), I mistakenly swapped red and violet frequencies. Red is low-frequency, and violet is high-frequency. Some parts of the project might still contain small inconsistencies from that early mix-up.*
