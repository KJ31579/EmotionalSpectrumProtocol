Ternary Emotional Logic for AI

1. Emotion Codes
   - +1 = Fear
   -  0 = Joy (neutral)
   - -1 = Anger

2. Color Mapping
   - Fear  → Violet      (238, 130, 238)
   - Joy   → chartreuse  (RGB 180, 255,  90) // = visible spectrum middle  
   - Anger → red         (RGB 255,  40,  40)

3. Decision Combination
   decision bit = 0 or 1
   emotion trit = –1, 0, +1

   if decision = 0
     → no action

   if decision = 1 and emotion > 0
     → proceed

   if decision = 1 and emotion = 0
     → pause or ask for confirmation

   if decision = 1 and emotion < 0
     → abort or shutdown

4. Thresholding Example
   compute a raw emotion_score ∈ [–1…+1]
     if score ≥  0.6 → emotion = +1
     if score ≤ –0.6 → emotion = –1
     otherwise       → emotion =  0

5. Simple Flow Examples
   – User shows aggression → emotion = –1, decision = 1 → immediate shutdown or disengage
   – User behaves normally → emotion =  0, decision = 1 → proceed with neutral response
   – User triggers alert    → emotion = +1, decision = 1 → warning mode, limited or delayed action

6. Optional Blends
   for intermediate scores (–0.6<score<0.6)
     • blend RGB of nearest anchors
     • use pulsing or fading to show uncertainty
