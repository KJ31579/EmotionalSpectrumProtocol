Ternary Emotional Logic for AI

1. Emotion Codes
   - –1 = Fear
   -  0 = Joy (neutral)
   - +1 = Anger

2. Color Mapping
   - Fear  → deep purple (RGB 110, 70, 175)
   - Joy   → chartreuse  (RGB 180, 255,  90)
   - Anger → red         (RGB 255,  40,  40)

3. Decision Combination
   decision bit = 0 or 1
   emotion trit = –1, 0, +1

   if decision = 0
     → no action

   if decision = 1 and emotion > 0
     → proceed

   if decision = 1 and emotion = 0
     → pause or ask for confirmation

   if decision = 1 and emotion < 0
     → abort or shutdown

4. Thresholding Example
   compute a raw emotion_score ∈ [–1…+1]
     if score ≥  0.6 → emotion = +1
     if score ≤ –0.6 → emotion = –1
     otherwise       → emotion =  0

5. Simple Flow Examples
   – user insults → emotion=+1, decision=1 → controlled warning or halt
   – user polite  → emotion=0,  decision=1 → normal assist or clarifying question
   – user threat  → emotion=–1, decision=1 → immediate shutdown or safe-fail

6. Optional Blends
   for intermediate scores (–0.6<score<0.6)
     • blend RGB of nearest anchors
     • use pulsing or fading to show uncertainty
