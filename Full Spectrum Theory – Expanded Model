Full Spectrum Theory – Expanded Model

1. Base Visible Emotions
   – Red       (255,  40,  40) → Anger (extreme output)
   – Chartreuse(180, 255,  90) → Joy   (neutral/optimal)
   – Violet    (110,  70, 175) → Fear  (extreme shutdown)

2. Full-Range Extremes
   – Black (  0,   0,   0) → Halt / system zero
   – White (255, 255, 255)→ Full power / system max

3. Middle Point
   – In hue: chartreuse is the midpoint of red–violet on the visible wheel.
   – In luminance (black–white range): mid-grey (128,128,128) marks pure neutrality across brightness.
   – Combined neutral state: chartreuse at 50% brightness → (90,127,45)

4. HSV Encoding
   – Hue   = emotion type (red/joy/violet)
   – Sat   = intensity or arousal (0–100%)
   – Value = system power level (0=black … 100=white)

5. Usage
   – Any sensor or logic output mapped into HSV then converted to RGB.
   – Black/white extremes guard against underflow or overflow states.
   – Mid-grey or half-bright chartreuse ensure a clear “balanced” signal.

End of theory.
