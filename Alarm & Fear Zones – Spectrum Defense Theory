Alarm & Fear Zones – Spectrum Defense Theory

1. Hot Danger (“Alarm”) Spectrum
   1.1 Safe Zone (Green)
       – Color: chartreuse (180,255,90)
       – System state: nominal, no action required

   1.2 Trigger Zone (Amber)
       – Color: amber (218,148,65)
       – System state: borderline threshold reached, caution advised

   1.3 Alarm Zone (Red)
       – Color: red (255,40,40)
       – System state: critical alert, immediate intervention

2. Cold Danger (“Fear”) Spectrum
   2.1 Safe Zone (Light Violet)
       – Color: lavender (200,180,255)
       – System state: low threat, continue monitoring

   2.2 Trigger Zone (Violet)
       – Color: violet (156,122,255)
       – System state: rising danger, prepare for shutdown

   2.3 Shutdown Zone (Deep Purple → Black)
       – Color: deep purple (110,70,175) fading to black
       – System state: uncontrollable hazard, safe shutdown

3. Usage Notes
   – Map sensor or input metrics to a spectrum value, then bucket into one of these three zones.  
   – Use the hot spectrum for “action-required” alerts, the cold spectrum for “shutdown-required” safeguards.  
   – Both layers can run in parallel for double-safety: a critical fault might trigger hot alarm and cold shutdown simultaneously.
