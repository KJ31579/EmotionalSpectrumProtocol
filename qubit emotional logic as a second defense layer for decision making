Quantum Emotional Logic – Two-Bit Defense Layer

1. Dual-Bit Model
   • Logical bit   = core decision channel = static system state 
       0 = passive (wait)
       1 = active  (execute)

   • Emotional bit = system state check = dynamic systems state 
       + = operate  (approve)
       – = shutdown (abort)

2. Double-Safety Rule
   if logical bit = 0
     → no action

   if logical bit = 1 and emotional bit = +
     → proceed

   if logical bit = 1 and emotional bit = –
     → abort or safe shutdown

3. Primary vs Secondary
   • The logical bit is primary: it must be “1” before any emotional check.
   • The emotional bit is secondary: it vetoes or confirms the primary decision.

4. Qubit Mapping
   • Use two qubits: one holds the logical bit, the other holds the emotional bit (+/–).
   • Measure the logical qubit first; only if it reads “1” measure the emotional qubit.

5. Example Use Case
   A quantum computer begins a heavy calculation:
     – logical bit = 1 (start)
     – emotional bit = + if resources OK → run calc
     – emotional bit = – if risk of overload → abort and reset

End of theory.
